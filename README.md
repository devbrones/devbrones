- 👋 Hi, I’m @devbrones
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about low level software development and operating system development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Rust, HTML, JS and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding development of new unix derivatives or other FOSS operating systems, and other projects regarding embedded applications.

- 👩‍💻 My current projects are LegatoBot (which is a discord bot centralized around sending information from the school platform Schoolity to students) and wol-api which is an API for the Watch-on-LBRY web extension.
