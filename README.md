- 👋 Hi, I’m @devbrones
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about low level software development and operating system development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C++ and some Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding development of new unix derivatives or other FOSS operating systems, and other projects regarding embedded applications.
- 📫 You can reach me using email: developer.contact.devbrones@protonmail.com
- 👩‍💻 My current projects are LegatoBot (which is a discord bot centralized around sending information from the school platform Schoolity to students), open2dig (which is a rendering engine that can convert a 3 dimensional object into a 2d greyscale relief for cnc carving and milling.).
